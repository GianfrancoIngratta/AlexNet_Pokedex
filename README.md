# AlexNet_Pokedex
The repository has the scope of classifying pokémon images, taken from the first generation ever released to the public, using an image recognition algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN): the *AlexNet* architecture.

## Pokémon Images Dataset
The basic idea is to feed the net with a set of known pokémon images and eventually test the identification capabilities of the algorithm. The chose dataset embeds only first generation pokemons (i.e. the first[Pokedex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generation_I_Pok%C3%A9mon)), and the images were taken from a public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one. Inside the dataset, the image distribution in not uniform. We decided to use only the images of the pokémons with the higher number of images, which were Mewtwo, Pikachu, Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur.
